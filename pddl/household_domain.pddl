;; FIXED, hand-authored PDDL domain for the LLM+P baseline.
;;
;; The operators mirror, one-to-one, the ROBOT_ACTIONS vocabulary and the
;; precondition / effect semantics enforced by pyplanner/verifier.py
;; (SymbolicState: arrived, found, holding, opened, on).  The point is that
;; LLM+P (classical-planner hybrid) and SAGE/GRACE (rule verifier) are
;; grounded in the SAME world model, so the comparison is fair.
;;
;; Predicate <-> SymbolicState field mapping:
;;   (arrived ?l)        <-> state.arrived == ?l           (robot at location/handle)
;;   (found ?o)          <-> state.found   == ?o           (last Find target)
;;   (holding ?o)        <-> state.holding == ?o           (object in gripper)
;;   (hand-empty)        <-> state.holding is None
;;   (opened ?c)         <-> ?c in state.opened            (container is open)
;;   (turned-on ?a)      <-> ?a in state.on                (appliance powered)
;;
;; STRIPS only (typing + negative preconditions) so that pure-python
;; planners (pyperplan: blind/bfs/wastar + lmcut/hadd/hmax heuristics) and
;; classical planners alike can solve it without ADL features.
;;
;; NOTE: this domain is intentionally PERMISSIVE on what counts as a
;; "location" vs an "object" vs a "container": every constant is declared
;; with type `obj` in the problem file, and the same constant can be used as
;; a MoveTo destination AND a Find target.  This matches the verifier, which
;; does not maintain a typed ontology either — it only tracks the 5 fields
;; above.  Keeping the domain untyped-ish avoids LLM type-assignment errors,
;; the single biggest source of unsolvable LLM-authored problems (risk R1).
